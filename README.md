Rust Lisp
=========

A simple implementation of Lisp in Rust. I'm doing this as a hobby over the
summer. This code won't be efficient or fast as I have not read/taken any
books/courses on compilers.

At the moment, the only thing that works is basic arithmatic (\+, \-, \*, \/). I
plan on adding ~define~ and ~cond~ later.
